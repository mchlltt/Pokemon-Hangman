# Pokemon Hangman
This repository hosts a pure JavaScript-based hangman game themed around the game Pokemon. It currently includes the first 493 Pokemon, minus about a dozen with names with non-alphabetical characters (e.g., Porygon2).

To play the game, you can either visit https://powerful-badlands-59082.herokuapp.com/ or clone this repository and open index.html in a web browser.

For those assessing the contents of the repository (rather than just wishing to play the game):
- The root directory contains the game's HTML, README, .gitignore, and Heroku App files.
- The assets/ folder holds the following subfolders:
  - css/ holds local stylesheets.
  - data/ holds Pokemon-related data and a cleaning script for that data.
  - images/ holds the logo, background, and all sprites.
  - javacript/ holds the JavaScript code for the game.
  - music/ holds an MP3 file per Pokemon.
